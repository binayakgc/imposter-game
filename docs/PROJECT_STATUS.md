# Imposter Game Development Progress Tracker

## Project Overview
**Game Name**: Imposter Word Game  
**Type**: Professional multiplayer web application  
**Tech Stack**: TypeScript, React, Node.js, PostgreSQL, Socket.io  
**Started**: [Current Date]

---

## Game Mechanics Summary
- **Multiplayer word game** with 4+ players minimum
- **Room system**: Public (open join) and Private (code-based)
- **Word giver rotation**: Each player gets a turn to provide words
- **Imposter system**: One random player (including word giver) becomes imposter
- **Goal**: Regular players find imposter, Imposter guesses the word
- **Theme toggle**: Optional categorized words vs player-submitted words

## Technical Architecture

### Database Schema (PostgreSQL + Prisma)
```prisma
model Room {
  id          String   @id @default(cuid())
  code        String   @unique
  isPublic    Boolean  @default(false)
  maxPlayers  Int      @default(10)
  themeMode   Boolean  @default(false)
  createdAt   DateTime @default(now())
  updatedAt   DateTime @updatedAt
  
  players     Player[]
  games       Game[]
}

model Player {
  id        String   @id @default(cuid())
  name      String
  roomId    String
  isHost     Boolean  @default(false)
  joinedAt  DateTime @default(now())
  
  room      Room     @relation(fields: [roomId], references: [id])
}

model Game {
  id              String      @id @default(cuid())
  roomId          String
  currentWord     String?
  wordGiverId     String?
  imposterId      String?
  state           GameState   @default(WAITING)
  roundNumber     Int         @default(1)
  wordGiverQueue  String[]
  createdAt       DateTime    @default(now())
  completedAt     DateTime?
  
  room            Room        @relation(fields: [roomId], references: [id])
}

enum GameState {
  WAITING
  WORD_SUBMISSION
  DISCUSSION
  VOTING
  RESULTS
  COMPLETED
}
```
